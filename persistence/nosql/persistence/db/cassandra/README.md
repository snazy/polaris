# Cassandra persistence backend

This module implements the Polaris NoSQL persistence backend backed by Apache Cassandra. It
uses the Apache Cassandra Java driver directly: Polaris creates and configures a `CqlSession`;
it does not use a Quarkus Cassandra extension or the driver's Typesafe Config integration.

For deployment configuration and bootstrapping instructions, see the
[Cassandra metastore documentation](../../../../../site/content/in-dev/unreleased/metastores/nosql-cassandra.md).

## Runtime integration

`CassandraBackendFactory` supports programmatic, non-Quarkus use. In a Quarkus runtime,
`CassandraClientProducer` supplies the application-scoped `CqlSession`; it also integrates:

- the Quarkus TLS Registry;
- Micrometer driver metrics, when a `MeterRegistry` is available; and
- the Cassandra readiness health check when Cassandra is the configured NoSQL backend.

The driver is configured from `CassandraConfiguration` and its `driver` subsection. Polaris
builds an in-memory driver configuration, so it neither reads nor requires a driver
`application.conf` resource. The generic `driver` subsection maps exact Java-driver option paths
to their typed driver values. Polaris owns the request timeout, metrics, and—when selected—TLS.
Refer to the
[Apache Cassandra Java Driver configuration manual](https://github.com/apache/cassandra-java-driver/blob/4.x/manual/core/configuration/README.md)
for the driver option names and semantics.

## Authentication

`auth.provider-name` defaults to `default`. When both `auth.username` and `auth.password` are
configured, Polaris creates the default plaintext driver authentication provider. An optional
`auth.authorization-id` is passed to that provider for servers that support proxy authentication.

For custom authentication, an integrator supplies a CDI `AuthProvider` bean qualified with
`@CassandraAuthentication("name")` and configures `auth.provider-name=name`. Native Java-driver
authentication options under `driver` cannot be combined with Polaris authentication settings.

## TLS and mTLS

For a Quarkus deployment, configure a named TLS Registry bucket and select it with
`polaris.persistence.nosql.cassandra.tls-configuration-name`. For mTLS with PEM files mounted
from a secret, the bucket needs the client certificate, private key, and the CA certificate(s)
trusted for the Cassandra server:

```properties
polaris.persistence.nosql.cassandra.tls-configuration-name=cassandra
quarkus.tls.cassandra.key-store.pem.client.cert=/etc/cassandra-tls/client.crt
quarkus.tls.cassandra.key-store.pem.client.key=/etc/cassandra-tls/client.key
quarkus.tls.cassandra.trust-store.pem.certs=/etc/cassandra-tls/ca.crt
```

Keep hostname validation enabled (the default) and configure the trust store with the intended
CA certificates. Do not use `quarkus.tls.<name>.trust-all` outside a controlled test environment.
The selected TLS Registry configuration is the only TLS configuration used by this backend; do
not set Java-driver TLS options under `driver` at the same time.
