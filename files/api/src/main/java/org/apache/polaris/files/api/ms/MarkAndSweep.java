/**
 * Mark-and-sweep approach to purge all stale/unreferenced files.
 *
 * <p>The overall approach is to first identify all referenced files from all tables and view (mark
 * phase) and then scan the object stores and purge the files that have not been identified as
 * "referenced" (sweep phase).
 *
 * <p>It is possible that not all unreferenced files are purged. This is because the implementation
 * uses a probabilistic data structure (bloom filter) to identify referenced files.
 *
 * <p>A typical caller performs the following steps:
 *
 * <ol>
 *   <li>Set up the {@link MarkAndSweepSpec} and call {@link #startMarkPhase(MarkAndSweepSpec)}.
 *   <li>For each table and view in the catalog, pass the result of {@link
 *       FileOperations#identifyIcebergTableFiles(String, boolean) identifyIcebergTableFiles()} (or
 *       {@link FileOperations#identifyIcebergViewFiles(String, boolean)
 *       identifyIcebergViewFiles()}) to {@link MarkPhase#mark(Stream)}.
 *   <li>Call {@link MarkPhase#finish()} to obtain the {@link MarkResult}.
 *   <li>If the {@link MarkResult} yields {@link MarkResult#canSweep()}{@code == true}, start the
 *       sweep phase by calling {@link MarkPhase#startSweepPhase(PurgeSpec)}.
 *   <li>For each object store, find all files using {@link FileOperations#findFiles(String,
 *       FileFilter)} and pass the returned stream to {@link SweepPhase#foundFiles(Stream,
 *       FileOperations)}.
 *   <li>Call {@link SweepPhase#finish()} to obtain the {@link SweepResult}.
 * </ol>
 *
 * <p>The {@link MarkAndSweepSpec} defines a bunch of constraints and parameters that influence the
 * mark and sweep phases. The {@link MarkAndSweepSpec#expectedFileCount() expectedFileCount} and the
 * {@link MarkAndSweepSpec#filterInitializedFpp() filterInitializedFpp} + {@link
 * MarkAndSweepSpec#maxAcceptableFilterFpp() maxAcceptableFilterFpp} attributes are used to
 * determine whether a sweep phase can be run or not. The default FPP values are suitable for most
 * use cases. The {@link MarkAndSweepSpec#expectedFileCount() expectedFileCount} value however must
 * be derived from the result of mark phase run by applying {@link
 * MarkAndSweepSpec#applyMarkResult(MarkResult)}, which will adopt the {@link
 * MarkAndSweepSpec#expectedFileCount() expectedFileCount} using the formula {@link
 * MarkResult#identifiedFiles() identifiedFiles}{@code * }{@link
 * MarkAndSweepSpec#countFromLastRunMultiplier() countFromLastRunMultiplier}.
 *
 * <p>Note that the sweep-phase <em>will</em> delete all files that are not marked as referenced
 * during the mark-phase. It is important to understand that this will delete all "additional" data.
 * To prevent the sweep-phase from deleting "additional" data, use the {@link FileFilter} parameter
 * of {@link SweepPhase#foundFiles(Stream, FileOperations)}.
