Polaris persistence, Cassandra backend-specific configuration. 

Configure Java-driver settings under `polaris.persistence.nosql.cassandra.driver`, using  exact driver option paths. For example, `driver.basic.contact-points=cassandra.example:9042` configures the driver option `basic.contact-points` .   

For Quarkus TLS or mTLS, set `tls-configuration-name` and configure the selected `quarkus.tls.<name>.*` TLS Registry configuration. This mapping does not contain certificate,  private-key, trust CA, protocol, or cipher-suite settings. A driver `application.conf` resource is neither needed nor consulted.   

Standalone users can configure the connection settings in this mapping, but cannot use `tls-configuration-name` , which requires Quarkus's TLS Registry.   

Additional Cassandra Java driver options can be configured under `driver`, using the  exact driver option path. For example, `driver.basic.request.consistency=LOCAL_QUORUM` configures the driver option `basic.request.consistency`. This is an in-memory driver  configuration; a driver `application.conf` is not used. The Polaris-owned request timeout  and metrics settings cannot be configured through this subsection. When `tls-configuration-name` is set, configure TLS settings exclusively through the Quarkus TLS  Registry rather than this subsection. Native driver authentication options can be used only when  the default `auth.provider-name` is selected and `auth.username`, `auth.password` , and `auth.authorization-id` are absent.

| Property | Default Value | Type | Description |
|----------|---------------|------|-------------|
| `polaris.persistence.nosql.cassandra.keyspace` | `polaris` | `string` | The Cassandra keyspace containing the Polaris persistence tables.  |
| `polaris.persistence.nosql.cassandra.advanced.ssl-engine-factory.hostname-validation` | `true` | `boolean` | Whether to verify that the Cassandra server certificate identifies the contacted host. <br><br>Disabling this option is unsafe and should not be used in production. |
| `polaris.persistence.nosql.cassandra.request.timeout` |  | `duration` | Session-wide Cassandra request timeout. Defaults to the larger of `ddl-timeout` and  `dml-timeout` when omitted.  |
| `polaris.persistence.nosql.cassandra.auth.provider-name` | `default` | `string` | The named CDI authentication provider to use in Quarkus deployments. <br><br>Defaults to `default`. With the default provider, Polaris uses username and password  when both are configured, or leaves authentication to the native driver when they are absent.  |
| `polaris.persistence.nosql.cassandra.auth.username` |  | `string` | Plaintext authentication username, used only with the `default` provider.   |
| `polaris.persistence.nosql.cassandra.auth.password` |  | `string` | Plaintext authentication password, used only with the `default` provider.   |
| `polaris.persistence.nosql.cassandra.auth.authorization-id` |  | `string` | Optional plaintext authentication authorization ID, used only with the `default` provider.  <br><br>This option is effective only with servers that support proxy authentication. Apache  Cassandra ignores it.  |
| `polaris.persistence.nosql.cassandra.driver.`_`<name>`_ |  | `string` | Additional Cassandra Java driver options, keyed by their exact driver option paths.  |
| `polaris.persistence.nosql.cassandra.tls-configuration-name` |  | `string` | The named Quarkus TLS Registry configuration to use for TLS or mTLS.  |
| `polaris.persistence.nosql.cassandra.ddl-timeout` | `PT5S` | `duration` | Timeout used when creating tables.  |
| `polaris.persistence.nosql.cassandra.dml-timeout` | `PT3S` | `duration` | Timeout used for queries and updates.  |
